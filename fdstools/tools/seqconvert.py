"""
Convert between raw sequences, TSSV-style sequences, and allele names.

FDSTools was built to be compatible with TSSV, which writes sequences of
known STR alleles in a shortened form referred to as 'TSSV-style
sequences'.  At the same time, FDSTools supports the creation of
human-readable allele names which are more suitable for display.

For example, the raw sequence
'AGCGTAAGATAGATAGATAGATAGATAGATACCTACCTACCTCTAGCT' might be rewritten as
the TSSV-style sequence 'AGCGTA(1)AGAT(6)ACCT(3)CTAGCT(1)', or as the
allele name 'CE9_AGAT[6]ACCT[3]'.

Seqconvert can be used to explicitly convert all sequences in a file to
the same output format.  Conversions are done using a library file, see
the help text of the libconvert tool for details.

You can specify multiple input files using the -i/--input option.  This
is especially useful when generating allele names for many samples that
have many sequences in common.  To call the variants in the allele
names, FDSTools needs to do sequence alignments which can be rather
slow.  When generating allele names for many input files at once, the
results of the alignments are cached which may give a significant
speed-up compared to generating allele names for each sample separately.

Seqconvert can also be used with two different library files to rewrite
the allele names or TSSV-style sequences after a library update.
Currently, the only limitation to this is that the ending position of
the left flank and the starting position of the right flank must be the
same.

Note that FDSTools makes no assumptions about the sequence format in its
input files; instead it automatically performs any required conversions
while running any tool.  Explicitly running seqconvert is never a
necessity; use this tool for your own convenience.
