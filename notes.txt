Changed in 2.0.0:
* FDSTools can now be run using 'python -m fdstools' too, which is helpful
  when the regular 'fdstools' command is not available on the PATH.
* FDSTools will now always use UTF-8 encoding for file I/O.
* FDSTools will now display a 'Failed to load X' message if importing tool X
  failed. The other tools will remain available.
* FDSTools will now display a 'Failed to configure X' message if configuring
  tool X failed. The other tools will remain available, and more information
  about the error can be obtained by running the troubled tool in debug mode.
* FDSTools will now display detailed error information when the -d/--debug
  argument is given, if an unexpected error occurs during argument parsing.
* Directly supplying a legacy TSSV library (tab-separated format) is no longer
  supported; instead, the Libconvert tool should explicitly be used to obtain
  a library file in the native format of FDSTools.
* Specifying multiple prefix and suffix sequences for one marker is no longer
  supported; users migrating their library files from v1.x to v2.0 will have
  to make sure only the first prefix or suffix sequence is retained.

Allelefinder 1.1.0:
* Removed the -c/--stuttermark-column argument. Allelefinder will look for stutter
  annotations in the "flags" column instead, if present.
* Allelefinder will now use the total_corrected column if present, else it will use
  the total column. The forward and reverse columns are no longer used by this tool.
* The -a/--max-alleles option now defaults to 1 for markers on the mitochondrial
  genome or the Y chromosome.

BGAnalyse 1.1.0:
* Fixed bug that caused non-integer percentiles to appear rounded down in the output.
* BGAnalyse will now use the total_corrected column instead of the forward_corrected
  and reverse_corrected columns. As a result, samples with 0 reads on one strand for
  a genuine allele are now accepted.

BGCorrect 1.1.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to apply noise correction only for the total
  number of reads instead of separately for either strand.
* The correction_flags column may now contain a comma-separated list of "corrected_X"
  flags, one for each tool used in the noise profile of that particular allele.
* Greatly reduced memory usage.

BGEstimate 1.2.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to estimate noise profiles for the total number
  of reads instead of estimating separate noise profiles for either strand.
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.
* The "tool" output column has been renamed to "tools".

BHomRaw 1.1.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to calculate noise ratios for the total number
  of reads only, instead of calculating separate noise ratios for either strand.

BGHomStats 1.1.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to calculate statistics for the total number
  of reads only, instead of calculating separate statistics for either strand.
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.
* The "tool" output column has been renamed to "tools".

BGMerge 1.1.0:
* Noise profiles for forward, reverse and total noise are now merged independently.
* The "tool" output column has been renamed to "tools" and now contains all tools used
  for the merged noise profile.

BGPredict 1.1.0:
* The default value of the -t/--min-r2 option has been changed to 0, effectively
  disabling the filter by default.
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to use stutter models trained on the total
  number of reads instead of the separate models per strand.
* Flanks are now ignored even if the library file is given; repeats may
  be interpreted as being slightly shorter if they continue into the flanks.
* The "tool" output column has been renamed to "tools".

Libconvert 1.2.0:
* Removed conversion from FDSTools to TSSV format.

Library 1.1.0:
* Introduce the new 'smart' library file and make it the default. All explanatory comments
  have been updated.

Pipeline 1.1.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to analyse noise for the total number of
  reads instead of separately for either strand.
* When the -d/--debug option is used, it is now applied to all tools ran in the pipeline.
* Fixed bug that required specifying the -r/--store-predictions option to run a pipeline
  file that contained store-predictions=True.

Samplestats 1.3.0:
* Added the -F/--min-allele-reads and -D/--max-nonallele-pct options, which can be used
  to suppress allele calls for low-coverage and high-noise markers, respectively.
* Changed the default value of the -b/--min-per-strand option from 1 to 0.

Stuttermark 1.6.0:
* Stuttermark now writes its annotations to the "flags" column.
* Removed the -c/--column-name option to change the output column name.
* Removed the "ALLELE" and "UNKNOWN" annotations.

Stuttermodel 1.2.0:
* Added the -C/--combine-strands option, to model stutter for the total number of
  reads instead of fitting a separate stutter prediction model for either strand.
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.
* Flanks are now ignored even if the library file is given; repeats may
  be interpreted as being slightly shorter if they continue into the flanks.
* Duplicate models are no longer produced for palindromic repeat units such as AT.

TSSV 2.1.0:
* Changed the default value for -a/--minimum from 1 to 2.
* Added the -L/--flank-length option, to specify the length of the anchor sequences to
  use, unless explicitly specified per marker in the library file.
* The -m/--mismatches option value will now be taken as an absolute number of allowed
  mismatches if it is larger than 1.
* Added support for GZipped FastA/FastQ files.
* Removed the error that occurred when the -D/--dir option is used and
  the output directory already exists.
* Don't abort if the report stream is closed; log a message to the
  report stream if the main output stream is closed.

Vis 1.1.0:
* Removed the -O/--online option.

Profilevis 2.0.1:
* Added ability to display background noise profiles operating on total read counts.

Samplevis 2.2.3:
* Fixed an issue that prevented manually marking additional alleles.
* Fixed an issue with restoring allele calls after the visualisation has been saved.
* Added ability to display background noise profiles operating on total read counts.
* Added ability to display multiple noise correction notes for a single sequence.

Stuttermodelvis 2.0.3:
* Added ability to display stutter models fitted on total read counts.








To-do:
* Homologation:
  * All tools should check the number of columns at each line (like Stuttermark does).
  * All tools should allow for additional columns to be present.
  * Make better use of print_debug() in all tools and postpone string formatting.
* Library functions:
  * Aliases, or some way to specify multi-copy markers with different refseqs like Amel.
  * Built-in library files.
* TSSV:
  * Ability to uniquely target overlapping ranges.
* Allelefinder:
  * Allow to set a minimum allele height for the lower allele.
* Group tools by function in the command line help and put Pipeline on top.
* Samplevis:
  * Detect whether correction was performed; hide related columns if not.
  * A PctOfAlleles column in the tables would be useful for mixtures.
  * Option to choose complete table download (all columns, not all rows).
  * Option to freely adjust the sorting (currently CE length toggle only).
  * Some of the media query breakpoints overlap, fix this.
  * Make Samplevis more responsive when rendering/updating graphs. To do this,
    the work should be broken up into chunks and each chunk should set off the
    next chunk through "window.setTimeout(nextChunkFunction);". The page will
    be repainted between each chunk. One major issue with this is that user
    input events may get scheduled between the chunks.
  * Allow table filtering options to be specified for each marker separately.
* Pipeline:
  * Add raw sequence output to ref-sample and case-sample analyses.
* Samplestats:
  * Add capability to run Samplestats again on its own output.
  * Add percentage-of-called-alleles columns.
  * Add per-marker allele calling settings to Samplestats.
* BGAnalyse:
  * Add columns containing the sequence of the highest/lowest noise and the
    sequence with the highest percentage recovery in every sample and marker.
* Vis:
  * Add grouping, show/hide options, and target coverage for BGAnalyseVis to the
    Vis tool.
  * Add r2 filter and stutter amount for Stuttermodelvis to the Vis tool.
* Exceptions to general mtDNA nomenclature: http://empop.online/methods
* Reduce noise profile memory usage:
  * Use sparse matrices in BGEstimate and BGCorrect.  May save over 90% of
    memory for the profile matrix after BGMerge of BGEstimate and BGPredict.
* Add 'BGDiff' tool to compare noise profiles.
* Add section to the library file where genomic positions of known pathogenic
  variants are specified. The TSSV tool should always output the reference base
  at these positions to comply with ethical regulations.
* Add options to Samplevis, Samplestats (and possibly other relevant tools) to
  filter alleles by sequence length.  The TSSV tool already supports this.
* Add visualisation with all markers in one graph ("samplesummaryvis"?).
* Add tool to analyse within-marker and between-marker coverage variation.
* Allow loading multiple files into HTML visualisations and provide prev/next
  buttons to browse them.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it computes forward and reverse in one go.  To do
  this, double the number of columns in P and C and put the forward profile in
  the left half and the reverse profile in the right half.  The benefit of this
  is that this ensures the same A is used for both strands, that is, the
  estimated allele balance is the same.
* Idea to make Stuttermodel for heterozygotes: compute a fit to the (weighted)
  profiles from BGEstimate.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it takes strand bias in the allele itself into
  account as well.
* Perhaps there should be a version of BGEstimate that makes a profile for each
  genotype instead of each allele.  This allows for the detection of hybrids.
