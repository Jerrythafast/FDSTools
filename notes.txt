To-do:
* Known bug: regex_longest_match does not give the longest match if a shorter
  match is possible and found earlier at the same position.
* Allow loading multiple files into HTML visualisations and provide prev/next
  buttons to browse them.
* Add tool to summarise various statistics about the entire analysis pipeline:
  (TODO: Write this list)
* Add "allow_N" flag to [no_repeat] markers.  If the flag is specified, the
  reference sequence may contain Ns.  People might need this for the rCRS mtDNA
  reference sequence.
* Allow simple marker name filtering in visualisations.
* Samplevis:
  * Add columns to the table of selected alleles that shows which tool did the
    filtering (if any) and what data was used to filter with.
  * Add 'percentage of marker reads' column in the table of selected alleles.
  * Add 'show negative alleles' checkbox in Filtering options (for diagnostic
    purposes - but default to TRUE).
  * Respect sorting rules when adding sequences due to lowered filters.
  * Make sure marker and allele names sort the same in Vega and in the tables.
  * Option to save the marker tables to a TSV file.
  * When we have them, add default values to table filtering (for reference).
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it computes forward and reverse in one go.  To do
  this, double the number of columns in P and C and put the forward profile in
  the left half and the reverse profile in the right half.  The benefit of this
  is that this ensures the same A is used for both strands, that is, the
  estimated allele balance is the same.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it takes strand bias in the allele itself into
  account as well.
* Perhaps there should be a version of BGEstimate that makes a profile for each
  genotype instead of each allele.  This allows for the detection of hybrids.
* Add plotting of raw data points to StuttermodelVis.
* Add visualisation with all markers in one graph ("samplesummaryvis"?).

Open Vega issues:
* Force layout parameter name: 'drag' or 'active'?
  https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/460
* Legend and axis corruption on signal changes.
  https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/446
* Feature request for lines (or arbitrary shapes) for legend items.

*TODO: add option to change single output to multi-out (batch_process=True)
^does not use add_args functions (bgmodel/predict use sequence_format_args)

Input/output conventions:
* Write single output to sys.stdout by default, allow changing by -o
* Write report (if applicable) to sys.stderr by default, allow changing by -R
* For multi-in to single-out: list input files as positionals
* For single-in: provide [IN], [OUT] positionals (defaulting IN to sys.stdin)
* Single-in batch support via -i/-o; mutex with positionals!
  (if len(-o) == len(-i), map infile->outfile; if len(-o) == 1,
   map sample->outfile by rewriting tag)
* Multi-in to multi-out: allow multiple values in -o option (currently unused)

Reserved option letters:
-h  Help (used globally)
-v  Version (used globally)
-d  Debug (used globally)
-i  Batch input files
-o  Output files
-R  Report file
-F  Target sequence format
-l  Library
-e  Sample tag extraction pattern
-f  Sample tag format

raw     name    OK - Uses raw->tssv as a first step.
