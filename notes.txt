To-do:
* Additions needed for publication:
  * Group tools by function in the command line help and put the new pipeline
    tool on top.
* Samplevis:
  * Detect whether correction was performed; hide related columns if not.
  * Option to choose complete table download (all columns, not all rows).
  * Option to freely adjust the sorting (currently CE length toggle only).
  * Visualise table filtering thresholds in the graphs.
  * Some of the media query breakpoints overlap, fix this.
  * Perhaps it is desirable to be able to request a list of 'Other sequences'.
  * Add 'Save page' button that also saves the alleles clicked by the user.
  * Add options to set the Table filtering options in the Vis tool.
  * Add ability to mark sequences that have a '*' in the 'new_allele' column
    (if that column exists at all). Used together with FindNewAlleles.
  * Make Samplevis more responsive when rendering/updating graphs. To do this,
    the work should be broken up into chunks and each chunk should set off the
    next chunk through "window.setTimeout(nextChunkFunction);". The page will
    be repainted between each chunk. One major issue with this is that user
    input events may get scheduled between the chunks.
  * Allow table filtering options to be specified for each marker separately.
* Add options for exporting data in CODIS format (and possibly others?).
* Add grouping, show/hide options, and target coverage for BGAnalyseVis to the
  Vis tool.
* Add per-marker allele calling settings to Samplestats.
* Exceptions to general mtDNA nomenclature: http://empop.online/methods
* Reduce noise profile memory usage:
  * Use sparse matrices in BGEstimate and BGCorrect.  May save over 90% of
    memory for the profile matrix after BGMerge of BGEstimate and BGPredict.
* Add 'BGDiff' tool to compare noise profiles.
* Add section to the library file where genomic positions of known pathogenic
  variants are specified. The TSSV tool should always output the reference base
  at these positions to comply with ethical regulations.
* Add options to Samplevis, Samplestats (and possibly other relevant tools) to
  filter alleles by sequence length. The TSSV tool already supports this.
* Add visualisation with all markers in one graph ("samplesummaryvis"?).
* Add tool to analyse within-marker and between-marker coverage variation.
* Allow loading multiple files into HTML visualisations and provide prev/next
  buttons to browse them.
* Samplevis HTML visualisations in IE11:
  * Printing striped table rows does not seem to work, though this might be an
    NFI-specific issue.
  * Tables are not perfectly aligned with the graphs (graphs render slightly
    differently). Firefox is just 1px off (using em units for positioning now).
  * When printing, IE11 respects the pagebreak hints. Chrome and FF are bugged!
* [Known bug]: pattern_longest_match does not give the longest match if a
  shorter match is possible and found earlier at the same position.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it computes forward and reverse in one go.  To do
  this, double the number of columns in P and C and put the forward profile in
  the left half and the reverse profile in the right half.  The benefit of this
  is that this ensures the same A is used for both strands, that is, the
  estimated allele balance is the same.
* Idea to make Stuttermodel for heterozygotes: compute a fit to the (weighted)
  profiles from BGEstimate.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it takes strand bias in the allele itself into
  account as well.
* Perhaps there should be a version of BGEstimate that makes a profile for each
  genotype instead of each allele.  This allows for the detection of hybrids.
* Add tool to summarise various statistics about the entire analysis pipeline:
  (TODO: Write this list)

Tool and visualisation version numbering, e.g., v1.2.3:
