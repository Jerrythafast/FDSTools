Input/output of tools:      INPUT           OUTPUT
allelefinder    list of sample files        *single output + report
bgcorrect       bg file + single sample (b) single sample (batches supported)
bgestimate      list of sample files        single output + report
bghomraw        list of sample files        single output
bghomstats      list of sample files        single output
bgmerge^        list of bg files            single output
bgpredict^      model + seqfile             single output
blame           bg file + list of samples   single output
libconvert^     single input library        single output
seqconvert      single sample file (batch)  single sample (batches supported)
stuttermark     single sample file (batch)  single sample (batches supported)
stuttermodel    list of sample files        single output
vis^            single sample (optional)    single output
*TODO: add option to change single output to multi-out (batch_process=True)
^does not use add_args functions (bgmodel/predict use sequence_format_args)

Input/output conventions:
* Write single output to sys.stdout by default, allow changing by -o
* Write report (if applicable) to sys.stderr by default, allow changing by -R
* For multi-in to single-out: list input files as positionals
* For single-in: provide [IN], [OUT] positionals (defaulting IN to sys.stdin)
* Single-in batch support via -i/-o; mutex with positionals!
  (if len(-o) == len(-i), map infile->outfile; if len(-o) == 1,
   map sample->outfile by rewriting tag)
* Multi-in to multi-out: allow multiple values in -o option (currently unused)

Reserved option letters:
-h  Help (used globally)
-v  Version (used globally)
-d  Debug (used globally)
-i  Batch input files
-o  Output files
-R  Report file
-F  Target sequence format
-l  Library
-e  Sample tag extraction pattern
-f  Sample tag format

To-do:
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it computes forward and reverse in one go.  To do
  this, double the number of columns in P and C and put the forward profile in
  the left half and the reverse profile in the right half.  The benefit of this
  is that this ensures the same A is used for both strands, that is, the
  estimated allele balance is the same.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it takes strand bias in the allele itself into
  account as well.
* Perhaps there should be a version of BGEstimate that makes a profile for each
  genotype instead of each allele.  This allows for the detection of hybrids.
* Add plotting of raw data points to StuttermodelVis.
