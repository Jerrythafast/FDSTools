Changed in 2.0.0:
* FDSTools will now display a 'Failed to load X' message if importing tool X
  failed. The other tools will remain available.
* FDSTools will now display a 'Failed to configure X' message if configuring
  tool X failed. The other tools will remain available, and more information
  about the error can be obtained by running the troubled tool in debug mode.

BGAnalyse 1.1.0:
* Fixed bug that caused non-integer percentiles to appear rounded down in the output.

BGEstimate 1.2.0:
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.

BGHomStats 1.1.0:
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.

BGPredict 1.1.0:
* The default value of the -t/--min-r2 option has been changed to 0, effectively
  disabling the filter by default.
* Flanks are now ignored even if the library file is given; repeats may
  be interpreted as being slightly shorter if they continue into the flanks.

Stuttermodel 1.2.0:
* Removed the random subsampling arguments.
* Flanks are now ignored even if the library file is given; repeats may
  be interpreted as being slightly shorter if they continue into the flanks.

TSSV 2.1.0:
* Removed the error that occurred when the -D/--dir option is used and
  the output directory already exists.
* Don't abort if the report stream is closed; log a message to the
  report stream if the main output stream is closed.

Vis 1.1.0:
* Removed the -O/--online option.



HOMOLOGATION
* Check that all tools check the number of columns at each line (like Stuttermark does).
* Check that all tools allow for additional columns.
* Standardise the 'flags' column and use it in more tools.
* Make better use of print_debug() in all tools and postpone string formatting.
* Could do a timeit run for {k: i for i, k in enumerate(l)} vs {l[i]: i for i in range(len(l))}





To-do:
* Suspected bug (marked with FIXME) in samplestats.
* Clean up samplestats code.
* Avoid reduce() in lib/seq.py
* Write 'INS' and 'DEL' in uppercase in mtDNA nomenclature.
* General:
  * Ability to bypass zero-reads-on-one-strand checks (ForenSeq requirement).
  * Link with STRNaming for allele nomenclature.
* Allelefinder:
  * Allow to set a minimum allele height for the lower allele.
* Group tools by function in the command line help and put Pipeline on top.
* Samplevis:
  * Detect whether correction was performed; hide related columns if not.
  * A PctOfAlleles column in the tables would be useful for mixtures.
  * Option to choose complete table download (all columns, not all rows).
  * Option to freely adjust the sorting (currently CE length toggle only).
  * Some of the media query breakpoints overlap, fix this.
  * Make Samplevis more responsive when rendering/updating graphs. To do this,
    the work should be broken up into chunks and each chunk should set off the
    next chunk through "window.setTimeout(nextChunkFunction);". The page will
    be repainted between each chunk. One major issue with this is that user
    input events may get scheduled between the chunks.
  * Allow table filtering options to be specified for each marker separately.
* Pipeline:
  * Add raw sequence output to ref-sample and case-sample analyses.
* Samplestats:
  * Add capability to run Samplestats again on its own output.
  * Add percentage-of-called-alleles columns.
  * Add per-marker allele calling settings to Samplestats.
* BGAnalyse:
  * Add columns containing the sequence of the highest/lowest noise and the
    sequence with the highest percentage recovery in every sample and marker.
* Add options for exporting data in CODIS format (and possibly others?).
* Add grouping, show/hide options, and target coverage for BGAnalyseVis to the
  Vis tool.
* Add r2 filter and stutter amount for Stuttermodelvis to the Vis tool.
* Exceptions to general mtDNA nomenclature: http://empop.online/methods
* Reduce noise profile memory usage:
  * Use sparse matrices in BGEstimate and BGCorrect.  May save over 90% of
    memory for the profile matrix after BGMerge of BGEstimate and BGPredict.
* Add 'BGDiff' tool to compare noise profiles.
* Add section to the library file where genomic positions of known pathogenic
  variants are specified. The TSSV tool should always output the reference base
  at these positions to comply with ethical regulations.
* Add options to Samplevis, Samplestats (and possibly other relevant tools) to
  filter alleles by sequence length.  The TSSV tool already supports this.
* Add visualisation with all markers in one graph ("samplesummaryvis"?).
* Add tool to analyse within-marker and between-marker coverage variation.
* Allow loading multiple files into HTML visualisations and provide prev/next
  buttons to browse them.
* Samplevis HTML visualisations in IE11:
  * Printing striped table rows does not seem to work, though this might be an
    NFI-specific issue.
  * Tables are not perfectly aligned with the graphs (graphs render slightly
    differently). Firefox is just 1px off (using em units for positioning now).
* [Known bug]: pattern_longest_match does not give the longest match if a
  shorter match is possible and found earlier at the same position.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it computes forward and reverse in one go.  To do
  this, double the number of columns in P and C and put the forward profile in
  the left half and the reverse profile in the right half.  The benefit of this
  is that this ensures the same A is used for both strands, that is, the
  estimated allele balance is the same.
* Idea to make Stuttermodel for heterozygotes: compute a fit to the (weighted)
  profiles from BGEstimate.
* Adjust BGEstimate so that it takes strand bias in the allele itself into
  account as well.
* Perhaps there should be a version of BGEstimate that makes a profile for each
  genotype instead of each allele.  This allows for the detection of hybrids.

   map sample->outfile by rewriting tag)
* Multi-in to multi-out: allow multiple values in -o option (currently unused)

Tool and visualisation version numbering, e.g., v1.2.3:
1   major version, changes only with large, disruptive, fundamental changes
2   minor version, changes when the default output is altered, or when it is
    otherwise likely that user pipelines will break when updating
3   patch version, changes with any other changes (bug fixes, new optional
    features, etc.)
